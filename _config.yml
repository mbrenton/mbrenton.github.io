  <br> Hi, thanks for visiting my page :3
  <br> Currently a student just trying to find my way
  <br> I made this because I thought it would be fun and it looked cool
  <br> Gonna use this to play around with css, html, js, and do whatever interests me with it <br>
  <br> Articles will be created at a later date
